I agree with the other reviewer.  The model looked nice and was inexpensive, but the coffee is never hot.  We always have to nuke it in the microwave, especially after adding milk or cream.     I would spend more on a better model. 
model looked nice ,
This machine makes a nice tasting Espresso that you can control the strength of.   However, the frothing attachment just doesn't work.   It sprays steam and and dribbles hot water into the milk.   It appears to froth, but as soon as you remove the mild from the steam nozzle it immediately deflates to hot milk.   Would be fine if I wanted a latte, but I want my cappuccino maker to make cappuccino. 
remove the mild from the steam nozzle ,
I use it for all my coffee and tea preparation.   You can even leave coffee and cold water overnight for the same result as a "cold water toddy".   You would need to buy a larger one if you planned to use it for a party.   Using water that is in a "rolling" boil will buy you a bit more time.   People who have not seen this before will think you are sophisticated.  The cover is plastic not metal. 
cover is plastic ,
  It is, although plastic, heavy and loud.   It does make a pretty good cup but at up to $1000 a pop this is durable goods and not like the $39. 95 white plastic coffee makers that one uses for a year and then assigns to the thrift shop. 00 for a repair at the factory is ridiculous. 
does make a pretty good cup ,
Not sure what trouble the previous reviewers had, but this is an easy to use coffee maker.   For the money, it does what one would expect: makes coffee.   It's not a Starbucks-quality coffee machine, but it makes pretty good coffee with the Starbucks beans I use.   I got mine at Target for $40.   I used to have a Cuisinart Grind-n-Brew (holy cow.   sounds like a jet engine), and I actually like this coffee better (maybe, in part, because I didn't pay $100 for it. 
easy to use coffee maker ,
 No filter, no mess, just push the button.     There's very little cleaning to do.  The machine comes with a cleaning disk (an empty T-disk) that must be used regularly, just as if making a cup of coffee.  It is the only regular maintenance the Tassimo machine requires. 
's very little cleaning ,
 I also love the green mountain coffee, they have great flavors and tastes wonderful.  On both of mine i use the K-cups instead of grounds and i have to say that it is so convenient.  I bought this product because i always felt so horrible about wasting so much coffee that is left in the pot and gets cold or bad tasting.  I have to say i really don't have any bad things to say about the keurig coffee maker, have had them for about a yr.  and never had any problems with it. 
have great flavors ,love the green mountain coffee ,
  The simplehuman seduced us with its slim, sleek design and the Bombay Sapphire-like hue of its water container and LCD display.   It comes with two trays to cradle your pods: one deep brown one and one shallower green one to accommodate different builds of pod.   We like to keep one for coffee and one for tea so as not to get any cross-contamination of flavors.   Like most single serve brewers it comes with settings for a large cup (8 oz) and a small cup (5oz).     Grins: The stylish looks.   The instructions are clear and use is simple. 
use is simple ,instructions are clear ,
    Grins: The stylish looks.   The instructions are clear and use is simple.   Priming is easily done and the water container smoothly removed, filled and replaced for use.  Switch it on, lift the lever, pop in a pod, lower the lever, select the size of cup, press the brew button and off you go. 
use is simple ,instructions are clear ,
  Two months later, we will be buying a replacement coffee pot.   While this coffee pot brews a fine cup of coffee, it also leaves us with a puddle of water on the countertop.       There is a little "overflow valve" on the back of the reservoir that is designed to spill over when too much water is in the reservoir.   However, we typically only brew half of a pot of coffee in the morning and the reservoir leaks without fail.   The water flows down the outside of the reservoir and travels down to the electrical cord.   Not a good design. 
brews a fine cup of coffee ,
  Storing the equivalent of these to a can of coffee takes a lot more storage space.      It's also very convenient for a cup of tea or cocoa for those who don't want coffee or when you want a change of beverage during the day.  The product variations are great, but the espresso, cocoa, cappuchino, etc.  are not as easy to find. 
product variations are great ,
     It's nearly maintenance free.  The filter needs to be replaced, the water reservior to be cleaned, and the cup stand emptied, depending on usage.  Every now and then you wipe off the pod stand too.  I like to keep a Brita filter pitcher filled and nearby since it needs fresh water regularly. 
needs fresh water ,
But then its made by Whrlpool of all things.   I know this because there is a recall on this product.   I have to admit that this coffeemaker does make a good cup of coffee but then just about all coffee makers do.   The hot plate DOES keep the temperature just right. 
does make a good cup of coffee ,
 The drip stop works fine.  Easy to clean.  I can't beleive I'm saying this: easy to fill with water.  The past coffee maker I owned had a very narow opening for the water; I kept spilling water all over the counter.  The flavor option is my favorite thing.  Highly recommended. 
easy to fill with water ,
 Waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee is the best.  This coffee maker makes a fine cup of coffee too.  I always use the "strong" brew feature, which takes slightly longer but it's worth the wait.  I use non-bleached paper filters. 
makes a fine cup of coffee ,'s worth the wait ,use non-bleached paper filters ,
5 oz version.   If you try to use a single k-cup for a 10+ oz cup it is too weak.   I do agree that they are more wasteful.   I try to justify it in that I don't ever throw away a whole pot of coffee anymore because I ruined it with bad math.     I have 3 friends ans 2 family members who have bought this same product after trying it at my house (all coffee addicts).   This really is a good product. 
is a good product ,
 I just wish the filters were available unbleached. 
filters were available unbleached ,
  The French Roast pods are pretty good.   The problem is quality control.       On the first one I got, the controls stopped working after a couple of months.   A few days later they mysteriously started functioning again.   A few weeks later, the same thing.   Gevalia sent a replacement. 
Roast pods are pretty good ,
I joined Gevalia to try a one cup coffee maker.   This machine made a nice cup of coffee, but it did not last long.   After using it three times, it stopped working.   Gevalia promptly sent a replacement. 
made a nice cup of coffee ,
 HOWEVER, I have to mail them the power cord (and be without my daily coffee until they send me a new unit. ) and THEY EXPECT ME TO PAY THEM $5 FOR POSTAGE AND HANDLING.   In my opinion, that's unacceptable.   Why should I incur any additional cost because their product is defective.  It's the principle that bothers me. 
product is defective ,
    Pros -   It brews quickly, there is no carafe to break and the coffee does taste good.     Cons -   The interior has a bucket [with handle] that you have to remove, fill with water and the fill the reservoir.   It is hard to read, prior to pouring, how much water you have put in the bucket [You are able to see once you pour it in how much, but barely].   Pouring is awkward because where you are pouring the water is such a tight space and I usually end up spilling water everywhere.   There is no timer (which we knew at purchase, but I do miss) and it's counter appeal is a little too "office industrial" for me.   It also doesn't seem to be as sturdy as I would like for a coffee pot in the $30-50 range. 
coffee does taste good ,'s counter appeal ,
 That's about the extent of the pro's.   Measuring is confusing as there are two sets of measurement lines, one inside the carafe and one outside, they are hard to read and not the same.   So far the hinge on the lid has broken, it has begun to leak like a sieve when dispensing coffee.  The carafe does not keep the coffee warm much less hot after it shuts off.   Will be buying a new coffee maker very shortly and can guarantee it will not be another of these. 
buying a new coffee maker ,
    It truly makes coffee that is clean and not funky tasting, It is easy to clean as the coffee pot disassmbles.  Also, the pot itself is a durable type of glass.  When cleaning it, you should use a sos pad and that will take your stains off the first time.  Also the filter basket is a little difficult to clean. 
easy to clean as the coffee pot ,
 Just a defective unit.  They were very nice and quickly sent a new unit within a week.  I tried it and I'm very disappointed .  Every 3rd cup I make actually tastes OK.  The other cups come out with too little water and produces a plastic tasting, smelly cup of coffee that is undrinkable. 
sent a new unit within a week ,
  The cover for the water reservoir actually shrunk after a few uses so I wonder where the plastic went.   I cleaned it for two whole days (vinegar, water, vinegar, water etc) to get the plastic taste out to no avail.   Overall this was very disappointing because of the time I invested in it to get it "clean" the time to buy it/then return it and my burned hand.   Too top it all off the coffee tastes burnt EVERY-TIME.   With different brands of coffee (and cold water, removing as soon as it's done brewing I'm really trying to make this work. ) so it is going back to the store tomorrow and I will find a different maker. 
find a different maker ,
This coffee maker is the most stupid design I've ever used.  And believe me I'm a big time coffee drinker.  It's not the electric machine that is screwed up, it's carafe.   Who in the universe came up with something that gets stained and coated with coffee from the very first pot and then is impossible to clean.   What idiots designed this.      Ok, so then I go on line to see if there is a safe way to clean it. 
'm a big time coffee drinker ,
Found this on sale at the Bay and liked the look of it.  I've had it for a year now and it makes a great cup of coffee. 
makes a great cup of coffee ,
  When I saw this built in coffee maker, I thought it would be worth the money for the additional counter-top space.   It works like a charm.   I was very surprised at the convenience factor of not having to fill the coffee maker every night before going to bed.   It makes a great cup of Joe and visitors always want to know how it works. 
makes a great cup of Joe ,
After experimenting with the various controls, I find the Jura-Capresso CoffeeTeam makes the best coffee that I have ever tasted.  I selected this pot because the bean bin can hold a few days worth, and it is easy to adjust the flavor.  And, there are no grounds everywhere as happened with a seperate bur grinder.  Please redesign the pot, though, to correct the flaws. 
easy to adjust the flavor ,
 Coffee units.   Then you need to make sure you close the carafe lid tightly before brewing.     The carafe itself is a thermos-like container; it&#146s stainless steel on the outside, with glass inside.   This is supposed to keep the coffee hot even when the coffeemaker shuts off after brewing, and it does, sort of. 
is a thermos-like container ,
  Drip pots rarely brew at the proper temperature and are even less likely to have a heating element that maintains it at a useful level.   Pressed coffee is wonderful but usually has no way to stay warm at all.   Not Your Grandmother's Percolator  The Farberware FCP412 is a part of a new generation of percolators.   It is blisteringly fast, brewing a cup a minute according to the manufacturer, and almost twice that fast in my experience.   It is brewed at just the right temperature, and its sleek stainless steel casing maintains the heat without burning the beverage. 
likely to have a heating element ,
 Brews lightening fast .  programming feature is nice .  but coffee grounds have to sit out all night going stale .  so I don't use it . 
programming feature is nice ,
This is the ultimate cheaper coffee maker.  It has an extra heater that raises the temp of the water just before it hits the grounds, extracting a fuller flavor from the beans.   the draw back is the tall carafe, not top shelve dishwasher friendly.   Ours broke after 2 years and I instantly ordered another. 
extracting a fuller flavor from the beans ,
    My first cup was delicious, it was definitely better than our old Black and Decker that made coffee taste very bitter.  This machine rivals any good coffee shop products.  I always handwash the water reservoir and milk container.      After months of use, I find that I like the 3-5 cup setting because it brews the coffee at a much slower pace, and stronger.     I really like this machine, I just hope that it last. 
rivals any good coffee shop products ,
  It brews a great pot of coffee.   Here's how I do it:  I put four heaping tablespoons of coffee into the pot.   I pour in boiling water and let it steep for 10 mintes with the lid on.   I press the plunger down, which pushes the grinds to the bottom and traps them.   The coffee only gets stronger as it sits, because the grinds are always in contact with the hot coffee behind the plunger/filter. 
brews a great pot of coffee ,
    After a comparatively short period of time the off and auto-off features have now broken and the cost to repair does not justify this expense.  The money is better put towards a new coffee maker.  With this fault the only way to turn on and off the coffee maker is to plug and unplug it.  The warmer now gets excessively hot and there is a safety concern as a result. 
money is better put ,
I love the idea of pouring into a thermos because I don't like the taste of coffee that sits on a heating surface for more than 10 min.   The problem is that the coffee that this coffee machine makes tastes simply awful.  I think the main problem is cap.  Even after thoroughly cleaning the cap (which is very hard to do) the coffee doesn't taste great. 
think the main problem ,
I love this little machine.   It is the first coffee maker I've had that is easy to clean and does not get coffee grounds or oils through the system.   It looks nice sitting on the counter and works well for tea or hot water. 
love this little machine ,
I love Bunn coffee pots - have used them for serveral years.   The pot brews excellent coffee which is a pro.   The con is that the coffee does not stay hot for very long.   After an hour, the temperature is already significantly cooler.   If you will drink  the coffe within an hour, it's a great pot. 
love Bunn coffee pots ,'s a great pot ,
Even my husband thinks it can't be beat.  Im taking the other one to work so my staff can enjoy it also.  Plus it will save us alot of money not going to Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. We usually spend $10 a more every day to get the pick me up we need in the afternoon.  I would highly recommend this machine to anyone who loves a great cup of coffee.  Wish the pods werent so expensive because I find myself drinking a lot more coffee now. 
loves a great cup of coffee ,
  It has a few features that the Braun didn't have.   The most convenient is that the water storage area lifts off to allow filling, preventing spills.   Another interesting feature is that when the time is used, the carafe is prewarmed before the coffee brewing starts to supposedly improve flavor.   I know that it does brew great tasting coffee but I can not attribute it directly to this feature, however.     This coffee maker also has a little more style than our old Braun. 
does brew great tasting coffee ,
 Coffee TFTX85 is poorly made.   The lid on the carafe just had small slits for the brewed coffee to go through, so it could be easily clogged.   I was too afraid to set the programmable timer for morning because I could be waking up to another mess.   After it had happened countless times, the clock no longer worked so, no timer anymore.   I finally stopped the overflow by buying a permanent filter that wouldn't fold over by water pressure. 
buying a permanent filter ,
I was really surprised at how good the coffee was from this pot.  I use the Foldger's and Senseo pods that I can buy at the Grocery store.  I have also used the permanent filter pods which worked great too. 
used the permanent filter pods ,
I was so disappointed in this coffee maker.   It just never made the coffee hot enough.   Everything else about it was great - it was easy to program, easy to fill, and I liked the looks.   But even when it was brand new it just never made the coffee hot enough.   Replaced it today with a Krups, and was so happy to have HOT coffee again.   Even after 4 hours, the coffee in the Krups carafe was hotter than my first cup of the day in the Mr. 
happy to have HOT coffee ,
  I am the only one who drinks coffee at my house and I don't drink much, so my grandma thought this product would suit me well.   It does come from a generally well respected company and since it is a "commercial" coffee maker perhaps it might stand the test of time and use.   They did have good customer service and did not charge me shipping for the new coffee maker.     This coffee maker has made fair coffee for me for about 2 years.   Usually coffee comes out tasting burnt or smelly from being burned.   There are several design issues that have made it difficult, including the grounds holder that is very hard to attach and detach. 
did have good customer service ,
  The tray also has a lid that you can remove or add to  accommodate larger coffee mugs.   I have found the heating process to be  quick, and have been able to enjoy my coffee or hot cocoa in about 3  minutes or less.   The Keurig also has an auto-off feature that will shut  off the appliance when not in use for about 2 minutes.   This version of  the Keurig is great for small spaces. 
version of the Keurig is great ,
Bought this coffee maker in 2002 and can't wear it out. )    The machine is fast and keeps the coffee hot with excellent flavor for hours.  The automatic feature works fine and I always have a great pot of coffee waiting for me every morning.  The reasonable price @ around $39 or less if on sale, is terrific.  I just don't see spending $100 or more for fancier machines when this one makes as good a brew as any. 
feature works fine ,have a great pot of coffee ,
Good enough so far.  The removable acrylic water tank may be useful to some but I think it is highly suseptable to breakage if dropped.        Fast forwarding to my primary issue with this product is that the caraffe is highly prone to spilling out large amounts of coffee as you pour.  The problem intensifies as you approach the last 2-3 cups until you are either cleaning up your kitchen counter or not pouring the coffee.  The spout design, although aesthetically pleasing is terrible.  I have not yet decided if I am going to keep this machine and live with spilling coffee or return it for a better conceptualized product. 
caraffe is highly prone ,
  I have owned it for over a year and have not had a single problem.   I follow directions and make sure to turn the "pot" over and run waters thru it EVERY time I clean it.   I have never had a leak.   I use it daily and it makes great tasting coffee.   No spill from trying to pour from a carafe and coffee stays hot without getting cooked. 
makes great tasting coffee ,
 When it stopped working, I was informed that it only has a one year warranty.  It is a lovely pot when it works, but it should certainly give you years of service.  Especially since this was used only once in a while for special family occasions.  I certainly do not want another Farberware as I entertain regularly and need something dependable.  As nice as the outside is, I believe the inside heating mechanism is not well made. 
is a lovely pot ,
 It also clouds the clock and takes a long time to brew when this occurs.  I thought we would have to toss it and call it a loss.  However,I got lucky and found the problem.       There is a hole in the carafe lid,of course,for the coffee to drain into the carafe while brewing.  Inside the lid there is a small ball that plugs that hole when pouring.  That ball occasionally gets stuck and causes the problem. 
is a small ball ,
 The flow stopper doesn't work, coffee keeps flowing as you're pouring a cup.  It leaks somehow through the bottom of the coffeemaker and you get this black sludge stuff under the unit that stains your counters.  It then burns onto the plate and the pot.  The temp setting for the warming plate is also useless, even on the lowest setting it still burns the coffee after only a few minutes.  A lot of engineering flaws in my opinion. 
warming plate is also useless ,
  All of a sudden it doesn't work.   Also, the warming plate does a very poor job, the coffee is never really hot.       My guess is that another piece of throw away technology has bit the dust.   You also got to understand that the manufacturers of coffee makers don't get good design engineers to work for them. 
get good design engineers ,
 I'm going to return it, not because I'm that unhappy with it, but only because I'm spoiled by the pour-through style carafe lid of another brand.  I thought it was broken until I bent way down and stared at it and saw a very small red marker.     The lid of the carafe is difficult to turn.  I am used to a pour-through design, which doesn't need to be opened after brewing, so I'm not sure if this carafe's lid is more difficult than usual. 
saw a very small red marker ,lid is more difficult ,
 We don't drink coffee on a regular basis, but we love inviting people over and making lattes and espressos.  The coffee feature is easy to use.  Although it does brew slowly, it has the best flavor we've ever gotten at home before.  Our old coffee pot left the coffee tasting metallic and burnt.  My fiance has no problem using the espresso side; he can get a better foam than I can. 
coffee feature is easy ,has the best flavor ,
Every morning I am rushing around, trying to get my daughter to school and hopefully getting to work on time.   I am an avid coffee drinker and this coffeemaker is great, I can grab it as I am running out the door. 
coffeemaker is great ,
I am TOTALLY disappointed in B&D. This machine does make coffee.  However, since it does not have a warming plate the coffee didn't stay hot enough for me.   Further, because the pot is stainless, you never know how much coffee is left in the pot.   I also had trouble with the screw on lid. 
pot is stainless ,
 I have two units (the oldest is about 6 years old), and have not had this issue.  I noticed that as the unit got older, the grind-basket needs extra "incentive" to sit into its sleeve.  If the basket doesn't go all the way into the sleeve, and you try to force the cover down, the cover would probably break.   Hope this helps.   BTW, I just contacted Melitta and this unit (and the larger one with the weather station) have been discontinued.  They said they are negotating with a new manufacturer, and should have a new type unit sometime in 2010. 
unit got older ,
This is a great coffee maker.  I love having a timer on the machine to start it so i have the fresh scent of coffee to wake to.  I love the 1-6 or 7-12 cup pot adjustment for when it's just me or I have guests. 
is a great coffee maker ,
 On two occasions, the buttons to turn the unit on and to turn on the Flavor+ feature malfunctioned.  Each time, the unit began working properly after I had left it off for several minutes.     It's difficult to find a replacement carafe for this model.  Mine broke (my fault), and I tried to find a carafe.  Hamilton Beach's site has links to other companies that supposedly have the carafe, but none of those companies had it listed when I checked.  Rather than wait an undetermined period, I decided to buy a new coffeemaker. 
buy a new coffeemaker ,
    It is great for the office or cube.   Not sure about other applications.   I suppose if you lose or break the mugs it come with you can use any similar sized and type of mug.     It comes with 2 14oz stainless steel somewhat insulated mugs.   The mugs get fairly warm immediately after brewing which means the insulation is not so great. 
is great for the office ,insulation is not so great ,
It brews coffee fairly quickly & the design is excellent.  The spray head is spring loaded & attached to the filter basket.  When the carafe is placed onto the warming plate it lifts the spray head so coffee can be dispensed through the small hole in the carafe.  This insures no splatter on the warming plate or the back plate. 
design is excellent ,
 We wanted a simple coffeemaker with no bells and whistles, just a simple drip machine and the only feature required was the "pause and serve".      Unfortunately the thin plastic attachment in the pause and serve feature broke within 6 months. just like the first one. but at least that one lasted a few years. 
wanted a simple coffeemaker with no bells ,
I'd visited CoffeeGeek and other sites to find what the best drip coffee maker available would be.  I had been using a small french press but it wasn't ideal as I don't like having to pour coffee into another holder after it's made.     The filter is a large square folded 2 ways.     The result is incredibly rich smooth coffee.      I bought it at Peet's coffee. 
using a small french press ,result is incredibly rich smooth ,
  I also like Egg Nog lattes and the Froth Xpress does not handle Egg Nog.   I need to have a wand to do Egg Nog.   The company will not sell me a wand as it does not fit with the "One Touch" machines.   So I am stuck with a $2,400 machine that makes great espresso, but my milk is heated in the microwave.   The machine has worked well for espressos, grinding, cleaning.   This machine is equipped with one step latte and machiatto buttons, but if it is not warm, it defeats the purpose. 
makes great espresso ,
 I'm not sure there are many of these machines still out there, since they have been updated since this model came out.  However, I bought mine refurbished for around $1200 a few years ago, and have not had any trouble with it.  This makes very good expresso.  Buy whatever brand beans you like and put them into the bean dispenser on top. 
makes very good expresso ,
  (there is a audible alert -but how many of us are actually in the kitchen when it goes off. )  This is most important as the carafe is thermal which means you cannot see the coffee in the pot either.   Most annoying and definately a design oversight. -Slow & awkward to pour the coffee as you have to hold it almost completely upside down to get the coffee to pour. -Cleaning the carafe is a challenge as the hole is very small.   Coffee tastes worst and worst unless I bite the bullet and struggle to clean it. 
challenge as the hole is very small ,
     This starts the hassle.  The coffee basket is easy enough to remove and clean after a twist and lift, but getting it back on is tricky.  If you make the mistake of putting water in the brewer, you can't tip the brewer back to see how to fit the basket back into the machine.  Be sure to put fresh coffee in before putting the water in, so you can wiggle or twist the basket back into place.      After the coffee is brewed, comes the next problem of pouring it into the cup. 
coffee basket is easy ,
 Cup" but a "4-1/2 Ounce Cup" is pushing it.   Next, they'll be calling it a 3-oz cup--but it won't make it a cup, will it.         Also, the V-shaped filter basket can not stand on the counter for filling.  (There may be others who prefer a flat-bottomed filter basket, so I'm adding his comment. 
prefer a flat-bottomed filter basket ,
Our family uses this product many times everyday.  The espresso is consistently good and the machine is very reliable.  Just follow the instructions and be sure to run the decalcification cycle when the machine calls for it.  The manual does not tell you that after warmup, you should run the steamer into an empty cup to clear it of water in the lines.  This will avoid adding water to your steamed milk. 
espresso is consistently good ,
 The coffee flavor is great especially on the Strongest setting.     Coffee stays hot for hours and you can actually control 'how hot'.   It's extremely easy to use and program.     The only down side is the FUSE.  We've replaced ours (4) times in 7yrs. 
coffee flavor is great ,
Originally purchased a coffee maker from a different manufacturer and returned it two days later --- the hinge on the lid was too flimsy.  I have owned several coffee makers over the years, and have found that this is the weakest area.     Love the Braun KF550.  It has a very sturdy hinge, a catch to keep the basket closed, a comfortable handle, and makes excellent coffee.  It is also very fast. 
lid was too flimsy ,
 I highly recommend one of those screen filters.     If you're seriously considering getting one of these systems (go for it. ), make sure you've got some headroom for this monster - it's almost 15" tall.   Overall, it's a really decent unit.   I noticed on Mr.  Coffee's site that they don't sell a replacement decanter for this model. 
's a really decent unit ,
We received this coffee maker after registering for it as a bridal shower gift.  It a nice looking coffee maker that had great features like pause and serve, different brew strengths, automatic timer, etc.  The first few days it seemed to work wonderfully.  After several uses, the carafe started to leak when we would poor a cup of coffee.  The spout is a neatly flat slot that the coffee comes out of.  After several months of use, the steam from the brew cycle cause our clock to fill with condensation and eventually stop working. 
had great features like pause ,
I've had this coffee maker for about 6 months now and I'm very satisfied.  Coffee's good reputation for being reliable was the main selling point when we purchased this machine.   Also, it comes in different colors;  red was the color we chose to match the decor in our kitchen.       One of my favorite features is the timer.   This comes in handy when you want to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee in the morning, right after you get up out of bed.   I think the smell of the coffee is a better "snooze" button than the one on our alarm clock. 
was the main selling point ,
 Fantastic machine built very solidly and should last years.  The coffee is fantastic, great crema and tons of flavour but not bitter.   Research the internet for espresso and cappucino making advice and you will be rewarded.  Takes a bit of practice to get the best results, but when you do, you won't look back. 
get the best results ,
Overall this is a great coffee maker -- large 15 oz. 
is a great coffee maker ,
This is my second thermal coffee maker.   This model is vastly superior to the Braun 8 cup I owned previously.   The Braun model died after about 40 uses and was just out of warranty.   This model makes outstanding coffee as it is both very hot and requires much less coffee grounds than my previous model.   I love everything about this coffee maker. 
model is vastly superior ,
  It has  a timer and a clock.   It shuts off in two hours, I would   like it to stay on longer because I don't drink my coffee  quiet that fast.   It is easy to clean and has a removable  filter basket to fill the coffee with grinds of coffee.   The place you put the water in is very wide and easy to  fill. 
has a removable filter basket ,
  As it started to brew we notice how weak the coffee looked (we had selected the 'strong' button).   On further investigation, we found that the grounds were not fine enough to fit through the built in filter.   We stopped the brewing, let it grind again, no luck.   Only half of our grounds made it through.   We let the brewing process complete hoping something would happen. 
grounds were not fine ,
 I have to move it out to set it up for brewing, then push it back for serving.   The lid that covers the water and the coffee is one big lid, making it impossible to fill wiile under upper wall cabinets.  If each compartment had it's own lid, opening back to back, it would require less space above the coffee unit to fill it.  The grinds made their way into the chamber that dispenses the water up to the top of the pot, clogging it up and preventing it from working properly.  My husband has done this twice.  The style of the water reservoir makes it difficult to get your hand into it for cleaning. 
require less space above the coffee unit ,
  The room I rented didn't have a coffee maker so for 10 bucks why rush out in the morning.   This is a dead simple product that has a built in [but replaceable]mesh filter and allows you to pour a cup while it is still brewing.  I also like the water level window on both sides of the reservoir.  This product is just as good or even better than any simular product that I have owned throught the years.   The resulting brew is comparable to any other cheap brand.   The hot plate keeps the brew at a good hot temp and doesn't seem to burn brew unless the caraffe is down to the last half cup. 
product is just as good ,
  Brewed coffee finds its way into a sturdy stainless thermal vacuum carafe.   The MT500&#146s carafe keeps coffee sipping hot for almost three hours.   The controls for the MT500 are in an awkward location; however, the controls work great and are sturdier than any other model I have ever owned.     I purchased mine from Coffee N Kitchen at www. 
controls work great ,
Very good and sturdy.  Hard to clean properly.  Charcoal filters are expensive and need to be changed often to get good coffee. 
filters are expensive ,
    Bottom line, my knob was not pushed all the way into the joint.   Even though I checked and rechecked my parts they really mean all the way.   Anyway hope this helps someone.   All parts must be really tight then you get perfect froth. 
get perfect froth ,
Have owned this machine for 5 years - it is great.   Excellent coffee and easy to use.   Wide range of settings lets you pick the strength of coffee, how fine to grind the beans, etc. 
fine to grind the beans ,
The coffeemaker I replaced was a Barista from Starbucks which made decent coffee and had a good thermal carafe.  But it developed a leak between the water container & the machine and the coffee basket was clearly starting to wear (1 & 1/2 yrs old).  My Starbucks coffeemaker was $150 on sale and the Capresso was $200 (at Williams-Sonoma).     It's everything I hoped it would be.      The steamer is excellent.   I've been using whole milk and it's great. 
had a good thermal carafe ,
  Has great features. It has some sort of Achilles heel in its design.   I had one and then after 6 months the reservoir would no longer hold water.   Called, complained, got a new unit.   Due to a shipping error they sent me two new units.   All three have done the same thing. 
Has great features ,
 I love, love, love coffee.  Sometimes I find that I am too busy or sidetracked to start a pot of coffee in the morning.  If I do take the time to brew coffee I forget that I made it half the time and end up throwing half a pot away.  What a waste of product and money.  The mini Keurig is perfect for me because it brews a single cup. 
mini Keurig is perfect ,
 Don't need more bells and whistles.  Simple, Good looking and makes a really good cup of coffee.  Have to pull further out from under cabs to pour water. 
makes a really good cup of coffee ,
 for 10 cups), finer grinds of coffee yield the best flavour.   The carafe is dripless, the "pause and serve" dripless as well.   Also, the carafe handle is a rubbery non-slip material and I haven't broken it yet.     Lastly it is great value.   Available everywhere for around $40. 
yield the best flavor ,
 The Nespresso Essenza C100 is perfect.  It makes a great, fast, lazy pull of espresso.  I really like the variety of flavors they have too.  When you purchase the machine you get a sample pack of about 12 flavors to help you figure out which ones you like.  I tried almost all of them within the first two days to figure out which ones I liked. 
Nespresso Essenza C100 is perfect ,
 It is weak, weak, weak, even at the small volume setting and with extra-bold K-cups.  I would not call it coffee, but something suggestive of coffee.  Given what I know of the Keurig process I can't imagine how it would ever produce rich coffee.  Now think about the Keurig process, where moderately hot water is mildly forced down the center of a cup of grounds in about 30 seconds total.  There just isn't enough time (or heat and pressure) for the water to extract the goods from the grounds.   There isn't. 
produce rich coffee ,
 I am a huge coffee drinker (about 3 cups/day).  I live alone and always hated brewing a whole pot of coffee every time I want just one cup.  That method often wastes precious coffee grounds.  My new Keurig Mini allows me to brew one cup at a time which means each cup is fresh.  The machine is compact so it fits in the tightest spaces.  Perfect for small NYC kitchens with limited counter space. 
cup is fresh ,
I first had coffee from a Flavia one-cup system at an office I frequented.   I like my coffee bold and hearty and the office Flavia was great.   I purchased a smaller size ($100) Flavia machine for our home and wish I had not wasted the money.   The coffees are bitter and do not have body.   The Mars company bought Flavia and I wonder if they changed the product.   Now I am looking into the Keurig and other systems, but am hesitant to spend $150 - $200 for another machine and be disappointed. 
office Flavia was great ,purchased a smaller size ,
I absolutely love my new DeLonghi Combination Coffee Espresso Machine I bought from www. LivingInComfort.   It is the perfect addition to my kitchen.   The look of the machine is so sleek and modern that I am not embarrassed to have it sit on my counter when I have company over.                   The DeLonghi Combo Machine brews a great cup every time.   Sometimes I have been confused on how to use espresso machines, but the DeLonghi is not like that. 
brews a great cup every time ,
  It is incredibly simple to use and the espresso is great.   The crema is perfect too.   My latte's rival those in coffee houses and I am saving a ton of money.   The "capsules" must be ordered from the Nespresso website, but they are usually at your door in 48 hours via UPS.   They give you a choice in the strength that you prefer and the capsules are cheaper than buying "pods".   The machine doesn't have a steamer/frother on it, but I bought the Nespresso Aeroccino to heat/froth the milk and I am very pleased with it. 
espresso is great ,crema is perfect ,
What led me to write this review, was the purchase of a B&D OCD425, SpaceMaker coffee maker to replace one of these.      In the small kitchen space in our office, it is great to have the coffee maker off the counter.  The one we had gave out after at least 3 years of making coffee continuously from 6am to 5pm.  It replaced a similar model that was replaced just because it was looking aged.     The SpaceMaker OCD325 simply makes good coffee, and stays out of the way. 
replaced a similar model ,
 I had done my homework before I left and checked to the the reviews here first.  I knew I wasn't going to buy a Black and Decker at any price.  Walmart had many of the B &D's too.  I am very happy that I did.  It makes good coffee at a cheap price. 
Walmart had many ,
Overall you will like this coffee maker if u want a thermal coffee maker that is easy to use, and retro-Euro styled.   The product seems really well made, was easy to set up and a bit larger than most others we are accustomed to.     However we like rather strong roasts such as Expresso and Italian roast.  The machine does not have a feature found on less expensive machines that is used for the times when u want to make 1 to 4 cups.  Therefore, it required nearly double the amount of grounds to get a taste that was to our liking since we typically brew in small amounts. 
like rather strong roasts ,
  As I use this on my sailboat, the fact that is unbreakable product is key.   The design is better than my home one as it has a filter on the pouring side, which keeps any grinds in the press (out of my cup).     The service from the Beaver Creek Shop / Handy House was excellent.   No whining about shipping to Canada and at an excellent price.   Even a personal follow-up on the mailing and arrival of the package. 
Creek Shop \/ Handy House was excellent ,
Our previous B&D SpaceMakers were great, but Model ODC405 is a total failure.   With good eyesight I have difficulty reading the LCD display.       Installation was easier than with previous models, but with only a minimal amount of space saved.      The fact that B&D keeps this inferior product on the market tells me to make my future small appliance purchases from another manufacturer. 
B&D SpaceMakers were great ,
 Coffee coffee maker.    This coffee maker grinds its own beans, has a metal micro filter and can be set on a timer to make coffee whenever it is convenient.  It also takes coffee grounds, if you prefer to by the grounds instead of the beans.   The buttons and functions were relatively easy to figure out. 
functions were relatively easy ,
The Aroma Express does a good job of producing coffee fairly quickly.   The 5 cup capacity is great for one mug and one travel mug of coffee to take to work.   Removing the coffee holder is simple for cleaning.   However cleaning the water reservoir is kind of a pain because it's narrow.   Now after approximately 18 months of operation, the switch simply fell out onto the counter, rendering the machine useless.   Think I'll check out the sturdiness of the switch in the next coffee maker I buy. 
cup capacity is great ,
  The Gevalia 85123 delivers.   Only two nits (aside from my carafe comments elsewhere in this article).  One, that it would have been nice if the body had been produced in a matte finish, but not if it would sacrifice the heating capabilities.   And two, it would have been nice if the brew- and water-delivery systems could have been front-loaded.

 Searching the web yielded some more reasonable prices.  One example is CoffeeGiant. com who lists all Green Mountain 25 packs for just over $9 and shipping is free for orders over $50.      If you like super-strong coffee and/or drink a lot of coffee, the cup size may be an issue. 
yielded some more reasonable prices ,shipping is free ,
  To replace them you have to go through Krups and each on was, with shipping, about $20, $40 total.   Add that to the price of the machine and I wish I had purchased a better product.   Coffee it makes is "ok" as is the expresso.   Another thing that I'm not too thrilled with is the steam from the expresso side lasts only long enough to heat one cup of milk. 
had purchased a better product ,
I loved this Delonghi but after a month it died.  I couldn't get any power to the unit.  I tried "shaking" both ends and trying an outlet that I knew was" live"- still no power.  This Delonghi model gets good ratings - I checked several review including Epinions. com     I was probably the one in 500 that had a problem. 
Delonghi model gets good ,
A year after using this coffemaker sporadically for about a year, it started to leak all over the counter.   The larger the pot of coffee I make, the worse the leak.   For it's price, I was expecting a better product.

 Also, don't use abrasive cleaners or steel wool, or you'll scratch the finish.  Make sure to dry it thoroughly before you put it away.  At this price, they make great gifts, but be sure to buy one for yourself, too. 
use abrasive cleaners ,make great gifts ,
Gets water on counter from opening the top after use.  You can hear the coffee being boiled after brewed.  Filter basket is difficult to get to trash with old filter without dripping everywhere.  Coffee gets cold very quickly if you shut off to stop the boiling.  Worst coffee maker I've ever owed. 
Filter basket is difficult ,
We received this unit as a gift and were excited about having a grind and brew as well.   For the first few months the unit worked great but we notice there was a great deal of moisture building up in the body of the unit.   We called customer care and were told there was no problem and that it was to be expected-which I found odd.   This has done nothing and, in our opinion, de-calcifying has nothing to do with the electronics-which they tried to convince me did. 
was a great deal of moisture ,months the unit worked great ,
  It makes great coffee.   It makes great espresso.   It makes okay cappuccino.   The problem is, it is made of cheap plastic.

  It makes excellent tasting coffee and looks good too.   A great feature.

 I still have a good selection of coffee making equipment, including plunger types.  Krupps drip type and even  percolators.  The afformentiond are mostly just collectors items now.  The C 1000 has been my best purchase yet.  This is an attractive beautifully designed machine that fits well into any kitchen or office.   I paid about $1700 CND for it. 
have a good selection of coffee ,
Based on the excellent service of the previous Krups, we bought the KT406 - BIG MISTAKE. The biggest concern is it leaks while brewing coffee.   We have to brew with a towel wrapped around the base and the unit sitting next to the sink.   The pot lid design makes pouring very difficult. 
pot lid design makes pouring very difficult ,
 Then I run 3 more pots of plain water through.  This keeps the inside of the system clean.  The glass pot can be washed with the rest of the dishes.     Because of the size of the burner, it is very easy to find replacement glass coffee pots.  Instead of purchasing the new pots, I have found many pots at yard sales that work just as well and save some expense.     After purchasing this last system, I have since found this same brand at both major discount stores Wal-Mart, K-Mart. 
easy to find replacement glass coffee pots ,purchasing the new pots ,have found many pots at yard sales ,
  With the DRX5, you can't close the top if the basket is not inserted correctly, so there is no possibility of dumping water.     Once I added water, it made the coffee faster than the B&D, and no evidence of ground splash-back.     It doesn't require any more coffee grounds than the B&D - and all of them stay in the filter, so the coffee is stronger than the B&D.   Once I remembered to add water, the delay brew has worked perfectly every morning. 
close the top if the basket ,
This is a very nice coffee maker that is easy to use, takes very little space, and has many nice features such as a timer.   It has an easily removable water tank that is taken to the sink for filling, then inserted into the machine.   Over a period of six months of use, approx 25% of the coating is now missing from the warning element.   Call B & D Help line, and was told that this problem is considered cosmetic, and is not covered by the warranty.     Black & Decker would be wise to stop using this black coating on the warming tray, and the sticking and/or cosmetic scarring would not occur. 
is a very nice coffee maker ,has an easily removable water tank ,
 As a nursing student I know that drinking plastic is not healthy.  I would stay away from spending money on this model.   What I did enjoy about this coffee maker was that it did not take up a lot of room and cleaned easily.   I also enjoyed having the automatic programmable brew. 
enjoyed having the automatic programmable brew ,
 Then it started taking longer and longer to warm up.  Decided it had earned retirement so I bought another just like it.  That savings alone goes a long way toward off-setting the extra energy it uses.     This coffee maker uses 800 watts for the 15 minutes it takes to heat the water in the tank.  The others use 750 to 1100 watts for the 10 to 15 minutes it takes to brew the coffee, so there's not a lot of difference there.  That's why it's a good idea to shut off the main power switch, if you aren't going to make coffee for a couple of days. 
's a good idea ,
It is impossible to clean this coffee maker.  The grounds basket gets very nasty, and is grooved, which makes it awkward to get clean.  The carafe has a piece of plastic that the lid is mounted to, that somehow captures coffee underneath it.  Even after washing the carafe, old coffee still drips out from under it.  There is also a metal band around the carafe base that mysteriously catches coffee in the same way.  The maker is so bad, that it's kind of a final joke that pouring coffee out of the carafe is like using a dribble glass. 
impossible to clean this coffee maker ,
  I was wrong.   The coffee produced by this maker tasted watered down.   I received the new spout in no time, free of charge.   To Bunns credit the customer service was great.   I installed the new spout and the coffee still had little flavor. 
Bunns credit the customer service was great ,had little flavor ,
This is the worst coffee maker I have ever had and I have owned Many thru the years.  Oh yes it gets more coffee on the counter than in my CUP. I would recomend you skip this thing and make your life easier.

I will never again buy a Farberware perculator, lasted  a little over a year and will not heat up or perk.   Farberware is not the degree or grade of excellence   it once was.        Susan R.

    The top of this machine is a railed platform (a very nice touch) which holds four cappucino cups or two cups and your frothing pitcher.     I've had this machine for two months now, and I'm extremely pleased with the excellent, consistent espresso and ease of use and ease of cleaning.  And it looks quite nice in the kitchen, too. 
looks quite nice in the kitchen ,
 problem solved.   Twice the unit has not started recently; nothing to do with the timer.   After picking it up and giving it a firm "bang" on the counter top (without the carafe) the insides seem to "wake up" and start brewing coffee.   Brews coffee at 167 degrees and stays hot for two hours with a reliable auto-off heating plate.   The auto-timer is really easy to use and saves prior start time.   Only need to adjust clock for daylight savings. 
auto-timer is really easy ,
  Since I paid only $18 and change I knew not to expect too much from the unit - but how hard can it be to brew a simple cup of coffee.     The 'Pause 'n Serve' feature suffers from coffee incontinence.   Contrary to the user manual I cannot remove the decanter in mid brew for a quick cup of coffee without coffee continuing to drip onto the hotplate.     If this is an example of an American-engineered coffee maker, I'll think twice about purchasing another Mr Coffee branded item in the future. 
brew a simple cup of coffee ,
The Braun Coffeemaker works and looks like you spent big bucks, but is surprisingly affordable.  The coffeemaker is sleek and sofisticated looking, and holds up to twelve cups of coffee.  It comes in handy for a quick morning brew for two, or a dinner party for twelve.  It is very simple to use, without all those complicated buttons on other machines. 
spent big bucks ,
    I thought the added bonuses of the containers (I use mine for coffee, as I use Equal packets for sweetener) was a nice touch.   I was puzzled by the tiny spoon, but it's purpose soon became evident.   It's the only little spoon that fits down inside the filter basket.       It packs in a suit case or tote (it even fits in my briefcase.       I had another occasion to use it recently:  When I broke the glass carafe to my 10-year old Braun Aromaster.   While waiting for a replacement carafe, this little guy saved the day. 
was a nice touch ,
 It leaves about a full cup in the carafe, unless you spilled it out already.     The LCD digital clock is NOT backlit and so cannot be read except by bending over and staring at it closely.   I called Cuisinart Customer support about it and they said the clock is to save money.     The programming control switch is also hard to read without bending over. 
programming control switch is also hard ,
 I called the company and they want a receipt.  Like I have one after 6 months.  I offered to mail pot but no way.  This is the last Black and Decker named product I will buy.  They sold their name to another company and this company's products are very poor.  This is the second B&D coffee maker I bought in a year. 
is the last Black ,
 It also is very stylish.   We previously had an expensive Capresso coffee maker, and this machine was an improvement in many ways over that one.     However, I am really disappointed in the strength of the coffee.  I like a stronger cup of coffee.  The coffee that this machine makes tastes good, but is way too weak and is just not satisfying.  I think that they should make different coffee bean grinder baskets with different sized screens which would maybe allow for a finer grind. 
like a stronger cup of coffee ,
This machine is very simple to use and make the best coffee ever.  I bhough it because I always wanted an automatic machine at home that can be easy to use.  make great coffee and it's easy to clean.  This machine give me everything I want for a good price. 
machine is very simple ,wanted an automatic machine at home ,
   After reading the manual and watching the included DVD I was making Starbucks quality drinks on the first day.  You will have to play with the amount of water and strength of coffee until you find what suites you, but it is just a matter of setting the dials.  The subsequent cups take less then a min.  The frothier works real well also and heat the milk up relatively fast.  And I love the adjustable coffee dispenser, It raises and lower to adjust to your cup size. 
love the adjustable coffee dispenser ,
I almost didn't buy this maker because I so many poor reviews, until I realized they were all by the same person.   So far, I LOVE THIS MACHINE.       I don't know what the other guys problem was, but my machine brews 10 cups of coffee in under 10 minutes.   The espressos are great with a good head of crema.       Overall, it seems to be working great, although I have only had it for a week. 
espressos are great ,
I find that this coffee maker for the price is well worth it.   Has all you need.   Brews fast.   No more filters to buy. 
maker for the price is well worth ,
  The dripless carafe isn't dripless.   The worst feature is the water level indicator.   It is  a tiny tube that is hard to read even when you bend down to get a bird's eye view.   It also get bubbles in it that frustrate the process even more.  I like the clean lines and the display.   Overall, too many frustrations for an $80 machine. 
like the clean lines ,
 I just hosted a party using the Mr.  Coffee CBTU45 45-Cup Coffee Maker and it was so nice not to have people waiting on coffee.  If you have crowds who like to drink coffee--whether it's for work or for home--this is the coffee maker for you.   It was very easy to measure the necessary amount of coffee and water.   If one only wants to make 36 cups of coffee instead of 45 cups, the measuring lines are very clear to read.   And it takes about 20 minutes to run the full cycle for 45 cups of coffee. 
measuring lines are very clear ,
  Its hard to explain, but a major design flaw. - The area below the express maker is too high for an express cup and too low for a standard express pot.   Still haven't found something that fits properly.  - The steaming element is very short and it is impossible to remove your espresso without hitting this very hot element. - The espresso is never very hot. This is not my first machine and I'm disappointed. 
maker is too high ,espresso is never very hot ,
This coffeemaker has a fantastic pot that pours without dripping all over the place.  I have purchased quite a few makers in the last year.  As soon as I find one that I think is nice something goes wrong.  This is a great maker except for the condensation from the waterwell. 
has a fantastic pot ,
This coffee maker has a good design, but the materials seem rather cheap (to go along with the price).  It had a very strong plastic smell when I first opened it.  I ran many cups of hot water through it, then let it sit for several months and the smell seemed to go away.  It has not worked since. 
has a good design ,
 It comes with three grounds holders, 1-cup, 2-cup, and one for the PODS.  As most of the Espresso makers on the market, you can't use a standard size cup to collect your java, they're way too tall.  The mechanism is simple and you manually control the amount of water dispensed.      Coffee Section: As eluded to by a previous reviewer, the production of coffee is really s-l-o-w. 
use a standard size cup ,
  I take my coffee seriously.   When I was younger I worked in the cafe of Barnes & Noble.   I think that's when I really started getting hooked on the stuff.  This is an excellent machine for anyone, but ideal for the apartment or dorm room scene.   One of the first things to consider when buying any appliance is the cleanup.   This little brew buddy is very easy to clean. 
is an excellent machine for anyone ,
After two units, and 4 months operation, I was thrilled that Bed, Bath and Beyond would take this unit back.  The supplemental instructions recommend cleaning the burr grinder every few weeks.  I decided to clean it every weekend.  You have to (1) remove all of the beans from the hopper (2) lay it on it's back side so the coffee dust build up can be removed. The biggest issue is that the coffee grinding is "in-line" with steam generated in the brewing process. 
's back side so the coffee dust ,
 The filter part of the machine swings out and is easy to fill with coffee grinds.  The mesh filter has a handle on the top, so it is easy to pull out and clean.    It is also nice that you can leave the machine on and keep the coffee warm for a while.    My only complaint with this machine is that the coffee pot pours kind of funny.  You have to pour it out kind of fast so that you do not spill coffee on you. 
easy to fill with coffee ,
 Dualit is also a well-known make for toughness and reliability and maintainability, especially with their toasters.     Well, the coffee was excellent with a good crema and still is.  There's a good size water tank and no glass parts to break.  The milk steamer/frother works very well (as long as you clean it regularly) and its all very easy to clean and maintain.     The seal went after ~1. 5 years and I phoned the helpline to get a new one. 
's a good size water tank ,
I am very pleased with the coffee maker.   We checked very thoroughly and definitely wanted this one.   The price was great and it arrived in perfect condition. 
price was great ,
    The coffee is brewed at 204F according to my thermometer in the basket, which is within standard tolerance of ideal temperature.  The spray head ix excellent with many holes giving complete wetting of the grounds.     One should not overfill the basket.     The taste is pretty good if you use good beans.  I grind mine fresh from premium beans, but it makes acceptable coffee   from pre-ground Folgers Colombian as well. 
taste is pretty good ,use good beans ,grind mine fresh from premium beans ,
BIGGEST PROBLEM: Makes a piping hot cup of coffee, but if you let it sit for 5 minutes, the pot warmer BURNS the entire pot of joe.  even on the lower heat setting. Brew basket and pot need to be PERFECTLY aligned, otherwise the coffee dribbles across the coffee pot top and FLOODS the counter. POOR MANUFACTURING QUALITY 1) My brew basket handle broke due to thermal cycling after a year. 
piping hot cup of coffee ,
    The heater shuts off automatically after two hours; too long after the coffee's flavor has soured from the heat(in about 40 minutes).     The removable filter screen is difficult to clean, but for you environmentalists, its a way to cut down on papers filters.     For those of you with gas stoves, your in luck.  You can boil water on your gas stove and still make coffee with this coffee maker.     Overall it makes coffee. 
filter screen is difficult ,
Coffeemaker functions well, but has very strong chemical taste and smell, which permeated entire kitchen.  Taste & smell persisted even with several flushings with hot water.  Returned it as a result. 
has very strong chemical taste ,
   Unfortunately, none of our efforts have made the coffee drinkable.   I personnally have switched to take-out 7-eleven coffee.   Some of us have attempted to water it down with hot water.   I've found, in "emergencies", I can make it passable by adding hot cocoa mix.   It's so very sad.   I was finally inspired to write a review when one of our patients commented, "you need a gun put to your head to drink that coffee. 
adding hot cocoa mix ,
 The service department is helpful and you usually get the technician on the phone quickly.  It takes a month to ship your machine to the service department and get it returned, so I have Gaggia Classic machine as a backup.  You do need to keep the packaging to return your unit for service.  The steamer on the S-7 is a little weak so frothing can be difficult.  Programing the  S-7 for your individual tastes is easy. 
tastes is easy ,
 Two months of heavy use, and it hasn't failed us yet.  Makes very good coffee.  The machine stays very clean and actually traps a lot of the coffee smell, as advertised.  Only the area just around the machine really smells like coffee, if that's important to you.     There are a lot of really nice features, including a light/dark brew adjust knob and a cleaning auto-notification for calcium deposits. 
machine stays very clean ,
 Not only will it look fantastic on your bench, but it is easy to clean and makes a lovely cup of coffee.  You can decide on the strength too and it is really quick.  I can honestly say I use this machine every morning and even sneak one in on an evening too now. 
makes a lovely cup of coffee ,
 it doesn't taste like coffee.   It smells good, at first taste it seems alright but by the time you swallow it's like coffee flavored water.     We tried up to 4 Tbls.  coffee per cup to see if it got stronger and it didn't.   We ground fresh espresso beans to see if that would help and it didn't. 
ground fresh espresso beans ,
I purchased mine from PC Plus for the lowest price I could find at $45.   It came quickly and, as advertised, it was brand new not refurbished.     The coffee is good, slightly strong (aka Moka) for American tastes and light for Italian or French.     Overall, I like mine with the two exceptions of it's messy-to-clean grind tray and its design of using the base as the water heating area.

 The price of this Hamilton Beach model was cheap, but I have been satisfied with other Hamilton Beach products so I decided to give it a try. It brews great tasting hot coffee, much better than my previous Black and Decker.  The coffee maker's black color and stainless steel styling looks great and the unit is easy to clean and easy to operate.  The water reservoir lid, filter holder, and carafe lid easily detach and can be placed in the dishwasher or dried by hand.  The instructions recommend that the carafe be hand-washed only.

 Unfortunately, it just doesn't make the coffee hot enough.  At this "starting" temperature, if you don't drink your coffee quickly (even black), it cools off before you're finished with the cup.  I tested the temperature drop off in the carafe over the course of 4 hours, keeping the lid sealed tight (after first removing 2 cups of coffee.  Starting from 165 degrees right after brewing, it dropped down to around 130-135 degrees within 3-4 hours.  Not even remotely warm enough to drink.

  The automatic shutoff is a nice feature which gives the user more peace of mind when it comes to safety.   No worries about forgetting to turn it off.   A slight downside is that the buttons are a little difficult to push.   They're kind of hard bumps covered in a plastic coating and it can be difficult to tell if you've succeeded in pushing the button.   Usually however, the coffee will either begin to brew or not.   This indicated how well you've done pushing the button. 
is a nice feature ,
      It has a removeable filter holder, so you dont have to worry about getting grounds all over the floor on the way to the garbage.       Now thats about all that I can find about this that is actually useful.     The first bad thing I found is, when you pour a cup, coffee gets all over the place, the floor, the counter, etc.     It only makes about four cups.     The warming plate is useless, it does not stay on after the brewing process is done.     It brews the coffee a little chilly, I like mine hot.

  This is a fast brewing machine, takes about 8 and a half minutes to brew a 12 cup pot of coffee.  Actually it is a fast leaking drip and makes a mess as well as burns the bottom of the glass pot when replacing it back on the burner.   Like I said, this is fast and it has an automatic timer which can be set to am or pm, not just a 12 hour cycle.   It also has an automatic shut off of 2 hours which is nice if you are running late.

  At our home 5AM is grind & brew time and it is the best way to wake up.   They also including a filter for your water if you do not have your water filtered at home, as we have whole house filtering.  Good water makes a good cup of coffee.  It is all buttons with no dials, one to program & set and one to start at anytime yourself.   You can also do 1-4 cups if you are not a 12 cups drinker like me. 
makes a good cup of coffee ,
CD player, TV, Microwave. The clock is no big deal to me).  The water is filtered, the gold filter is included, the brew time is quite fast.  The coffee tastes as good (if not better) as that from any other home coffeemaker I've experienced. 
coffee tastes as good ,
The lateral columnator allows one to accurately make up to 8 cups of coffee. The filter basket obviates the need for paper filters because the basket is easily removeable and can be washed in a dishwasher. The metallic container is virtually unbreakable and has a well insulated handle for pouring hot coffee. The container keeps coffee hot for a long time.

  Like I said, this is fast and it has an automatic timer which can be set to am or pm, not just a 12 hour cycle.   It also has an automatic shut off of 2 hours which is nice if you are running late.   It also has a strength control for the coffee.   I like the machine, but for those of you (like my husband) who likes to take a cup before it is done, I cant recommend it.   Try another brand for that purpose.   This opinion is on the proctor silex easy morning 41464.

  None of the coffee makers were unknowns, and they all had excellent reviews.   This makes the best pot of coffee I have had in some time.   It is my belief that most coffee machines that are listed has having 'smooth coffee' generally mean bland coffee.   Coffee is supposed to be robust and flavorful and have plenty of aroma.   What it is not supposed to be is bitter.  The Zoji makes this excellent pot of coffee. 
had excellent reviews ,
  Same with the frother.   It makes excellent froth in medium and small quantities when you know the trick (less than 24 fl. , plenty for even smaller three lattes at once) but runs a bit low on steam for large jobs.   It is an inexpensive unit and has its quirks as a result.   All in all considering the price this thing is excellent. 
makes excellent froth in medium ,price this thing is excellent ,
 Easy to use, cheap, great coffee.  I'm getting addicted to my coffee every day more and more.  the timer is easy to set and punctual as a swiss clock to get my hot coffee ready when I wake up. 
timer is easy ,
This pot makes good coffee.  I like the idea of less clutter on the counter because the grinder is combined with the coffee maker.  I would buy this again.  Next time, I would probably look at the stainless steel model, too. 
pot makes good ,
  The Thermal pot is a very nice pot but is a little odd in that most thermal pots can be closed to hold in the heat.   This pot when screwed all the way on is in the pour position. There is also a generic 48OZ round plastic pitcher to fill the coffee maker. The TE116 also does not include any Coffee Filters and the instructions do not even hint as to how much Coffee to add to make a pot of coffee. 
is a very nice pot ,
