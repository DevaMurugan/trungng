  The performance of this product is excellent, with no leakage, no spilling, no excessive steam spewing out.   Brewing: It is fairly quick to brew.   The coffee is quite hot (an important point for me).   During brewing, no water spills out (something that happened regularly with one of my previous big-bucks models).   No excessive steam.

The water tank has a level ball and cup indicator on the side of the pot.   The ball does not always go up with the water without a tap but the water remains clearly visible in the indicator.     The digital timer buttons are the real downside to this pot.   They are roughly 1/2 inch long a just about 1/8 inch wide.   They can be awkward to hold down and set.

The lid has to be almost completely unscrewed to pour the coffee without it coming from the little hole in the top of the lid.   I found this out when I didn&#146t unscrew it all the way and got burned.     The inside of the carafe is just like some thermos bottles and can be broken if dropped very hard.      My recommendation is not to buy this coffee maker.   There are better coffee makers out there for the money you would pay for this one.   Try a Bunn for a little more money and faster better tasting coffee.

The transparent plastic window built on the side indicates exactly how much water you actually poured into the coffee maker.         With that much said, It finally gave way today.  This coffee pot produced great results and provided many pots of coffee, but with hidden flaws, it services are now rendered due to it's only flaw.     CONS      Although this coffee maker has out-performed every coffee maker put to the test so far, it also came with a major flaw: The hot plate.        The materials made for this plate is ferrous.  It rusts within a year, interrupting it's peak performance.

You can use the carafe when you're at home or brew just a mug to take to work with you.     There are just a couple of negatives about this coffee maker.   One is that it's somewhat hard to fill the water tank.   It seems that the top does not open quite wide enough or stay open by itself long enough to get the water poured in.   My advice is to use a regular measuring cup with a spout to pour the water in rather than the carafe.

Thermal CarafeI've been wanting a thermal carafe for some time because I hate the way coffee tastes after it sits on the burner.   This coffee pot automatically turns itself off when it's finished brewing so there's no extra cook time to make the coffee taste bitter. I also thought that silver would look nice on the counter because it would match the stainless appliances in the kitchen.   I found it to look a little cheap, but it is acceptable. My excitement for the thermal carafe ended when I realized the drawbacks outweighed the benefit.

Grins: The stylish looks.   The instructions are clear and use is simple.   Priming is easily done and the water container smoothly removed, filled and replaced for use.  Switch it on, lift the lever, pop in a pod, lower the lever, select the size of cup, press the brew button and off you go.   We haven&#146t had any trouble so far fitting coffee pods of different brands into the deep brown cradle or tea pods into the green one.     Gripes: It does tend to drip a bit after it has finished.

I had a great coffee maker that stopped working after 10 years.   When it came time to replace it, I decided to buy the Black & Decker Spacemaker.   The main reason I wanted this coffee maker was that it was programmable and was affordable.     SPACE:  The SpaceMaker is actually bigger than I thought, so it does not really clear up much counter space.   However, the little bit that it does open up is perfect for small items.

This is the worst design for a coffee maker that I have ever seen.   The company obviously did not test this product before selling it.   I had to return this item to the manufacturer after only six months of use.   Although they replaced the first coffee maker, the second one has the same faulty design problems.   The ground basket frequently overflows causing a huge mess and the flow will often 'short-out' the electronics that make the coffee maker work.

It's also very convenient for a cup of tea or cocoa for those who do not want coffee or when you want a change of beverage during the day.  The product variations are great, but the espresso, cocoa, cappuchino, etc.  are not as easy to find.   They can be found online if necessary.      It's nearly maintenance free.

This coffee maker offers 24-hour programming with a digital clock timer.   Very easy to use and settings are precise.   It also comes with a temperature range adjuster so you can keep the pot warm or hot.   I like to keep it in the middle so my coffee does not turn to mud while I finish my pot.

  With the cuisinart I make 10 cups and get 10 cups of coffee. I found it easy to program the time and set it to automatically turn on in the morning.   It also has the option to brew a small pot of coffee (1 to 4 cups), which I have not tried yet.   There is also the option to turn the grinder off if you have pre-ground beans.   I used this function when I brought it home to clean the machine with water before making any coffee. The grinder holds enough beans to make a strong pot of coffee, and the grinder is about as loud as my traditional coffee grinder.

With the fineness set to the mark second from the left and the Strong setting on the control panel I was able to achieve a very nice cup of coffee.     The unit also features a charcoal water filter which may or may not be necessary depending on whether or not you use bottled water.   If you do use bottled water the filter element is easily removed.   A full pot takes about 12 minutes to complete.  That way you can use the Luxe to make flavored coffees and not void the warranty.

But in general, time in the pot, and heat are coffee's enemy.       The principle behind any drip coffee maker is pretty simple: Heat water, let it drip through some ground coffee, and you are ready to sip away.  There are some variables to consider.  First and most important: use quality freshly roasted whole beans.  Grind them immediately before brewing.

Along with the coffee unit, you get 2 mugs and a couple of #2 coffee filters so you can make coffee as soon as you open the box.     The Coffee Unit is black and the two 14 ounce mugs are stainless steel with rubber, nonslip grips around the middle.  I put a cotton wrist band over the grip so that a larger area is available for his hand and this seems to work fine.      The lids fit on securely, helping to keep the coffee hot.  Their extra deep sipping well and the rubber pads on the bottom help to prevents spills.      I have read that the mugs and their lids are dishwasher-safe and I have read where they are not.

We do not drink very much coffee, so this coffeemaker is excellent.  It's very easy to use and quick.    I even make coffee for one with the Bialetti Class 6-Cup Coffee Maker.   Experience with it.  Like if you are trying out a new recipe.  Use different brands of espresso coffee, vary with the amount of coffee.

This front-swinging unit has a tendency to pop open DURING BREWING unless you *slam* it shut and push hard to make *sure* it's shut before brewing.   Of course, when it swings open during brewing, disaster happens with water and coffee all over the place.   Lastly, a minor beef.   The stainless steel body looks nice, but it's a pain in the rear to keep clean.       One good thing I found is that this unit has a special button on it for when you are brewing 1-4 cups of coffee.   It changes the brewing characteristics and makes the small amount of coffee come out tasting good and not burnt and/or watery.

We seem to go through coffee pots - not able to settle on one that we like.     The Hamilton Beach 47111 12 cup coffee maker is fine for the purpose of making coffee, but we may well be on our way to purchasing something else.     Pros -   It brews quickly, there is no carafe to break and the coffee does taste good.     Cons -   The interior has a bucket [with handle] that you have to remove, fill with water and the fill the reservoir.   It is hard to read, prior to pouring, how much water you have put in the bucket [You are able to see once you pour it in how much, but barely].

Results:  After mastering the loading of the unit, the results were mediocre at best.   The process by which the water is heated appears to add some bitterness to the water.   I have tried both tap and bottled water.   At first, I thought it may have just been the coffee singles (Folgers).  I determined that it was not, after using the coffee in a cup brewed in the microwave.     The process of heating the water is also very loud.

Overall this was very disappointing because of the time I invested in it to get it "clean" the time to buy it/then return it and my burned hand.   Too top it all off the coffee tastes burnt EVERY-TIME.   With different brands of coffee (and cold water, removing as soon as it's done brewing I'm really trying to make this work. ) so it is going back to the store tomorrow and I will find a different maker.

(any coffee remaining in the pot is certain to become cold fast, as the heating element beneath it turns off as soon as the coffee is made. ) as i enjoy my coffee from an extra-large-sized coffee cup, after only a few minutes, it was at an unacceptable drinking temperature.  also, although there is a digital clock on the front, it needs to be reset every time the coffee maker is unplugged.  the instruction manual suggests unplugging the unit when not in use.  lastly, i found the overall design to be rather bulky, taking up premium counter space.  in short, this black and decker coffee maker was a waste of my valuable time.

I've wanted a coffee maker for ages, do not drink instant stuff, but really enjoy a cup of "real" coffee.  I only had one of those cafetiere(. ) things which is more like a coffee pot but makes a decent cup.  My mum bought me this one, and I have to say it makes really awful tasting coffee.  I always used - I do not use it any more - the double sized pods for one mug or two small cups, but even then it's weak, watery and just plain nasty.

After experimenting with the various controls, I find the Jura-Capresso CoffeeTeam makes the best coffee that I have ever tasted.  I selected this pot because the bean bin can hold a few days worth, and it is easy to adjust the flavor.  And, there are no grounds everywhere as happened with a seperate bur grinder.  Please redesign the pot, though, to correct the flaws.

  The Tassimo does a reasonable job of making that morning cup of coffee the best that it can be.   At a cost of $120, I will confess that I expected more.   While I have not tried the Keurig, I have heard positive comments that have made me regret this purchase.   The Tassimo coffee is more expensive and harder to find than the Keurig cups.

  Blade grinders like the Cuisanart, I learned, heated the beans and tended to give them a burnt flavor.   The conical burr grinder was gentler (although a bit slower) and did not adversely affect the taste of the beans. The Capresso is extremely easy to use.   In most cases you'll only do this once or twice until you find the setting that works best for you.   Add beans to the hopper, and water, and you're ready to brew.   You can use the permanent gold filter that is provided, or paper filters (which I prefer as they make for easier cleanup.

We are using the same coffee as in the other machines so I know that the DeLonghi is great Too bad that it has the big leaking problem, so sad. This seems to me like the engineering of this product is not good , they could fix this leaking problem if they wanted to.  I was slow to react to the situation, if I did not like the coffee so much I would have just tossed it out in the trash.

This is the ultimate cheaper coffee maker.  It has an extra heater that raises the temp of the water just before it hits the grounds, extracting a fuller flavor from the beans.   the draw back is the tall carafe, not top shelve dishwasher friendly.   Ours broke after 2 years and I instantly ordered another.

Coffee is hot after brewing.  The carafe stays hot for several hours and there is no burnt coffee or automatic shut off to contend with like regular makers.      Cleaning is a breeze.  Traditional makers I found are difficult to clean under the drip above the grinds and around the burner.  This maker has no burner and the drip above the grinds is easily wiped down with a cloth.

First, I will explain how this nifty coffee gizmo works, and then I will explain why I've rated it poorly.   Filling the water reservoir is fairly easy with the included carafe, because the carafe is not as spill-prone as most.   It is easy to see the water levels in the reservoir, even in the grey, bleary-eyed twilight of pre-caffeine mornings.   Filling the grind compartment is also a snap because the whole thing comes out of the machine.   The final component is the filter basket, which Cuisinart made accessible by a spring-loaded basket that swivels out and away from the machine.   Steamy grounds also have a tendency to collect on the cover for the filter basket, so make sure to rinse that out right away as well.

The only real draw back I see so far , is cleaning the top part where the coffee brews.  It does have a removable container where you put the filter in to brew, but its the part under that , that is harder to clean.  There is not that much , but enough where you want to get it out.  I guess its just awkward to wipe it up.  Also the water well is very hard to clean out , very deep , and I can not get my hand in there to wipe it out.

It is very straightforward.   It makes 12 cups; it has one button (on/off); it turns itself off after two hours; is easy to clean; was reasonably priced ($49.     Other reviewers have said that it is cheaply made.   I think that the plastic is as strong as any other pot I've purchased.   The lid and surrounding edge of the coffee pot are a light gray plastic.   It cleans up very easily and is less prone to stain than the ones that are all white.

  The lid on the carafe just had small slits for the brewed coffee to go through, so it could be easily clogged.   I was too afraid to set the programmable timer for morning because I could be waking up to another mess.   After it had happened countless times, the clock no longer worked so, no timer anymore.   I finally stopped the overflow by buying a permanent filter that would not fold over by water pressure. That is it for me.

I think this will be around for three to four months before I start looking for a replacement.    The good points to this are that it brews fast; my old coffee pot felt like it took forever to make a half pot.   Seriously.   I'm not saying this is lightening fast but three minutes for five cups is pretty damn good if you ask me.   That's another thing I needed to get used to; this is a twelve cup coffee maker and I was used to a ten cup.    The numbers on the carafe are easy to ready and there are two water windows on the side of the coffee maker; both levels are exact.

They did have good customer service and did not charge me shipping for the new coffee maker.     This coffee maker has made fair coffee for me for about 2 years.   Usually coffee comes out tasting burnt or smelly from being burned.   There are several design issues that have made it difficult, including the grounds holder that is very hard to attach and detach.   The decanter lid always pops off when I am trying to wash it, and the decanter itself leaks all over the place.   This is especially true if it is full.

  The excess water is easy to remove by simply pulling  out the tray.   The tray also has a lid that you can remove or add to  accommodate larger coffee mugs.   I have found the heating process to be  quick, and have been able to enjoy my coffee or hot cocoa in about 3  minutes or less.   The Keurig also has an auto-off feature that will shut  off the appliance when not in use for about 2 minutes.   This version of  the Keurig is great for small spaces.

The removable filter basket is easy to clean, as is the espresso ground basket.  The milk storage tank is a bit more difficult to clean and remove.  Naturally, the machine is programmable, but the clock gains time randomly and it is quite annoying.  In an average month it probably gains 5-10 minutes.  But, as long as you remember to watch that the clock is close to the right time, the programmable function works fine.

Bought this coffee maker in 2002 and ca not wear it out. )    The machine is fast and keeps the coffee hot with excellent flavor for hours.  The automatic feature works fine and I always have a great pot of coffee waiting for me every morning.  The reasonable price @ around $39 or less if on sale, is terrific.  I just do not see spending $100 or more for fancier machines when this one makes as good a brew as any.

The coffee maker is black in color, and it can make up to 12 cups.  It has a glass pot, and on it there are white markings indicating how much is in the pot.  The pot also has a little flip top lid that can be taken off.  You can wash the pot in the dishwasher on the top rack.  This also has a pause and serve feature where you can take the pot out and pour yourself a cup while it is brewing.  My brother has no complaints about this coffee maker and he said the coffee was good.

Coffee under the cabinet one died.  We were spoiled with the hot coffee our Mr.  Coffee Maker made.   This machine is well designed and very easy to use, however the coffee seemed warm and did not stay warm by the time you finnished your cup.  We returned the machine back to the store.

I&#146d been pricing these for about 2 years so when it got down to $40, I went for it.       If you&#146re like me you don&#146t get around to your second cup right away and reheating, even in the microwave, isn&#146t a great solution.  I&#146m the only coffee drinker in the house; the 8 cup size works well.

We do not drink coffee on a regular basis, but we love inviting people over and making lattes and espressos.  The coffee feature is easy to use.  Although it does brew slowly, it has the best flavor we've ever gotten at home before.  Our old coffee pot left the coffee tasting metallic and burnt.  My fiance has no problem using the espresso side; he can get a better foam than I can.  Cleaning it is easy, except for the little espresso filter.

There is a permanent metal filter available as an extra cost option.     What I like most about this machine is the ability to adjust the intensity of the coffee.   If you like strong coffee, this machine comes set for wake-the-dead coffee.  It's not expensive to add it, but it seems like a strange oversight in a machine that is overall well-thought-out.      All-in-all, though, it's a really durable little item.

The machine's Filter Basket is removable and comes out of the brewing area for simple cleaning.   I'm not sure about all of the TF5 series makers, but the TF5GTF that I recently purchased, included a reusable Gold Tone Filter.   This was a must feature for me since I did not want to hassle with paper filters. Each side of the water reservoir has very easy to read Water Level Markings which make filling the machine a very simple operation.   The water level is just as easy to see with no guessing what-so-ever.

Adding water is relatively easy, except that one has to almost completely upturn the carafe to empty it completely.   So, big deal, no.   It also makes cleaning the pot difficult, since no adult hand can fit inside the relatively small opening.   The brewing cycle also seems a good deal longer than that of the Krups unit it replaced.     So, those quibbles aside, I have to say that the Mr.

I'm not sure there are many of these machines still out there, since they have been updated since this model came out.  However, I bought mine refurbished for around $1200 a few years ago, and have not had any trouble with it.  This makes very good expresso.  Buy whatever brand beans you like and put them into the bean dispenser on top.  The machine grinds the beans whenever you make a coffee product, so you cup is always fresh brewed.  You can dispense hot water for tea, etc, setting it to the amount you want every time.

If you are in the rush there is the anti-drip function to sneak a cup while still brewing.      I like the hot red look and design and maybe the best feature for me is the warm up option.  This let's you keep the coffee warm for hours without burning the pot.     I'll be sipping my morning cup again tomorrow from my metallic red pot and I believe it will taste as good as coffee gets.      Now I only need to find a matching hot red new toaster to go with it to make my winter mornings as merry as they can get.

Our family uses this product many times everyday.  The espresso is consistently good and the machine is very reliable.  Just follow the instructions and be sure to run the decalcification cycle when the machine calls for it.  The manual does not tell you that after warmup, you should run the steamer into an empty cup to clear it of water in the lines.  This will avoid adding water to your steamed milk.

The coffee this Mr.  Coffee makes is pretty good tasting, but of course that greatly depends on the quality of coffee you choose to put into it.   Use cheap canned coffee and of course your coffee wo not taste as great as freshly ground gourmet coffee.   No rocket science needed to know that, but I had to add it to my review.   It always bugs me when people use cheap coffee and then blame it's finished quality on the coffee maker.

It's a great little coffee maker, except for the issues keeping correct time.

This is my second thermal coffee maker.   This model is vastly superior to the Braun 8 cup I owned previously.   The Braun model died after about 40 uses and was just out of warranty.   This model makes outstanding coffee as it is both very hot and requires much less coffee grounds than my previous model.   I love everything about this coffee maker.

The Capresso MT500 brews through a water filter to enhance flavor and the heating element is non-aluminum.   Brewed coffee finds its way into a sturdy stainless thermal vacuum carafe.   The MT500&#146s carafe keeps coffee sipping hot for almost three hours.   The controls for the MT500 are in an awkward location; however, the controls work great and are sturdier than any other model I have ever owned.

Most of my appliances are royal blue and it would have been nice to have this match. 99, I'll get over this soon.     This coffee maker is easy enough to clean.   All pieces can go in the dish washer and I've never melted anything yet.   [I also make sure to put all plastic items on the top shelf though.

Makes a decent cup of coffee.  The carafe can be difficult to pour from.  Either it comes out unevenly and slowly spills or you have to pour it out at a very slow pace.  Besides that it performs quite well.

  Works as described, takes little room on the counter and the coffees and teas you can buy, rivals whats on the shelf in your supermarket.  Its so easy to use, no mess and you can take it anywhere.   I recently brought it to a birthday party and made guests their preference of coffees and tea selections.   It made a big hit.  I was skeptical about the tea, but it actually came out darker and had more flavor that a brewed cup using a tea bag.

You now have the option to insert the Kcup flavor of your choice or move on to the next step if you choose to have a cup of tea.  Now you are ready to close the cradle by pressing down  the "Press To Open Tab", which exposes the single cup water reservoir.  You can add water to the fill line or go an extra quarter cup for just a smidge more out of that morning glory.  The flashing blue led prompts you to start the brewing process, which takes all of three minutes. It all seems so perfect, but is it.  Well complaints we had with the premium brewer at the office were that there just was not enough coffee in the cup after the brewing process.

If anything does happen to get past that filter, there is also a piece of mesh right where you drink.  I have used it nearly every day since I got it, and it is great quality.    The mug itself is stainless steel, with the color in a glossy finish on the outside.  I have the original Iris (purple) color, but now there are many more from which to choose.  The stainless steel helps to keep your drink hot for a long time.

 I would not call it coffee, but something suggestive of coffee.  Given what I know of the Keurig process I ca not imagine how it would ever produce rich coffee.  Now think about the Keurig process, where moderately hot water is mildly forced down the center of a cup of grounds in about 30 seconds total.  There just is not enough time (or heat and pressure) for the water to extract the goods from the grounds.   There is not.

Both options are expensive vs.     If you want coffee perked and done when you wake up, you'll want this model because of the timer.   If you have a particular brand and brew you want, this should be OK as you can buy filters and put your own coffee mix in there.     If you're a light sleeper and your kitchen is close to the bedroom, be prepared for the HCKKKHCCHKH that this (and most) coffee makers makes.   If you're a coffee drinker, this is your wake-up call.

Maybe it seems like too much work to me; maybe it seems pretentious.   I do not know - I'm just sure I prefer a machine.     I never seriously considered a percolator, though several friends who are  serious  coffee drinkers say they're far superior to the drip machines.   I've never had a problem getting good coffee from a drip maker, and there's a great selection, so I kept to the familiar.     After visiting a couple of stores, I had a pretty good idea what was out there.

The cord is long enough to permit placement on a counter in locations other than directly in front of the outlet.     My only complaint is that when pouring the last of the pot, the lid has a tendency to leak around the threads.  Opening and closing is easy as the closed position is marked with an arrow and a simple 180-degree turn does the job.  I do wish that the pot held ten cups rather than 8, but that's a personal preference.      It is important that the carafe be removed immediately when brewing is complete.

The DeLonghi Combo Machine brews a great cup every time.   Sometimes I have been confused on how to use espresso machines, but the DeLonghi is not like that.

I did not know which machine in the store to get, but the sales clerk helped me make the decision to buy this one.   It is incredibly simple to use and the espresso is great.   The crema is perfect too.   My latte's rival those in coffee houses and I am saving a ton of money.

Overall you will like this coffee maker if u want a thermal coffee maker that is easy to use, and retro-Euro styled.   The product seems really well made, was easy to set up and a bit larger than most others we are accustomed to.     However we like rather strong roasts such as Expresso and Italian roast.  The machine does not have a feature found on less expensive machines that is used for the times when u want to make 1 to 4 cups.  Therefore, it required nearly double the amount of grounds to get a taste that was to our liking since we typically brew in small amounts.

  I find that I am not buying as much coffee so this machine is saving me money.   The fact that there is no carafe to wash or break saves time and effort and the one-cup dispenser allows for a hot cup of coffee each time.     I recommend this machine for any coffee lover who likes a fresh cup of coffee on hand at all times without the bother of brewing new pots.   It is easy to use, easy to clean and puts out a mighty fine eye-opener in the morning.

Once you get the desired amount you pour it into the water reservoir, which is directly underneath the coffee tank.     For iced coffee it almost the exact same except I cut the amount of water in half and I put a tray of ice cubes in the coffee tank.  It is also very important to remember to turn the automatic heater  to off or your nice cold coffee will soon become very warm coffee.     The Coffee tank cannot be put in the dishwasher but the filter basket and drip tray can be used in the top shelf.     Overall    Using this coffeemaker has been a breeze.

With an easy to use interface and  a simple to use one button activation system the tassimo is quick and easy to use. A modern and sleek design will make this product a great addition to any kitchen.   The Disc System- The main advantage of this product is the easy to use tassimo disc system. You simply select your required disc and place it into the disc holder situated on the front of the unit. Once completed you simply remove the used disc and dispose of  with the minimum of cleaning required and you are ready to repeat the process. With new products being added all the time the tassimo is a versatile product that will last for many years to come.

Taste:   One of the best cups of coffee I have had in a long time.  The coffee was the perfect temperature.  The automatic shut off, will shut the idle pot off after two hours, but you can just hit the "On" button to start the warmer plate up again.     Clean Up:   If you have owned one of the multiple piece grind and brew machines you will love the ease of clean up on this one.  Basically, you clean out the removable filter holder.  How cool is that.

Our previous B&D SpaceMakers were great, but Model ODC405 is a total failure.   With good eyesight I have difficulty reading the LCD display.       Installation was easier than with previous models, but with only a minimal amount of space saved.      The fact that B&D keeps this inferior product on the market tells me to make my future small appliance purchases from another manufacturer.

This coffee maker grinds its own beans, has a metal micro filter and can be set on a timer to make coffee whenever it is convenient.  It also takes coffee grounds, if you prefer to by the grounds instead of the beans.   The buttons and functions were relatively easy to figure out.  It is a bit messy to clean up after, with multiple parts to clean, but the quality of the brew is worth it.

This means that at two cups or a little less of espresso the water produced by this machine is at the optimal temperature to brew espresso.  After two cups the water going through your espresso will be too hot and therefore will burn your espresso.  So if you want to make espresso for one latte you can do it well with this machine.  If you want to make more than that you need to brew again.  So if you want an inexpensive espresso machine that produces good quality lattes cappuccinos or just plain espressos this is the machine for you.

You simply add water to the bottom compartment, add the coffee into the filter, and set it on the stovetop to boil.  It's safe for gas, electric, or ceramic stovetops.  Also, do not use abrasive cleaners or steel wool, or you'll scratch the finish.  Make sure to dry it thoroughly before you put it away.  At this price, they make great gifts, but be sure to buy one for yourself, too.

The insulated carafe keeps your coffee hot and fresh tasting for MORE than 4 hours.  It brews the coffee through the lid directly into the carafe to seal in flavor.  It has the sneak-a-cup feature, easy to read water window and the filter basket and brew-thru lid are dishwasher safe.  You have to wash the thermal carafe by hand and it looks very fragile on the inside.  It brews coffee very quickly and there's a regular or decaf setting on the handle.

At just about $100, we expected more.   The pause and serve feature does not work, coffee continues to pour out, and the hotplate has peeled because of it.  The pot fits so tightly under the coffeemaker that it is difficult to snap into place.  The lid to the coffee pot is very hard to take off and put back on.  This would be an extremely hard coffeemaker to use if I were elderly or had arthritis.  Two capable adults could not open the lid to the coffee pot.

I just received my  Bunn NHBX-B 10-Cup Coffee Maker and after carefully following directions made my first cup of coffee for my husband.   He said it was the best cup of coffee he had had in a long time.   As long as it keeps up the good work, I will give this coffee maker 5 stars for coffee.   Be sure to read that closing the lid starts the hot water flowing rather than a switch.

Materials used on the Santos coffeemakers are prone to crazing, staining and breaking.  The top hinge is poorly designed and subject to frequent breakage (I've gone through 3).      The mini is the little brother to the 3000 and 3001 - the only difference is size (3004) is smaller, and the 3000 has a built-in timer.     In the case of coffee preparation, Proctor-Silex in the 40's had a stove-top stainless steel design upon which the bodum unit is based.     Two compartments - one for water and one for dry coffee, are separated by a gasketed funnel assembly.

What I REALLY wanted was a method to remove the variables so I could discover how to make a really good cup of coffee.   You remove the top chamber (and can store it with a neat storage piece stored in the base) and the pitcher is the serving piece for the coffee.     Cleaning - The material the coffee maker is made of is a hard plastic.   It's amazing, but it does not seem to stain, maybe because it's so hard.   All it takes is a swipe with a soapy dishrag and it's sparkling clear again.   The only complaint I could even dream up is that the pitcher has a lip that makes it difficult to empty fully.

Once that beans and pot are in place, it is a simple 4 button combination to start the coffee brewing.  As one might guess, this process is overcomplicated by a ways and actually required consultation with the owner's manual.  This is certainly the first coffee maker I have ever had which required that little unmanly action.    On this same first using of the machine we also attempted the venerable espresso.  This met with less satisfaction than the coffee.  What we were able to produce was a watery mess without any foam or milk.

I cannot be happier with this machine.   It works quickly, like a charm.   Coffee is very  hot (would not want it hotter).   I've been wetting the pods beforehand and using the tea button to brew my coffee -- could not be happier with the results.       We bought this machine for an office setting, so that people could choose their own drinks with little to no clean up.   Now I'm wishing I had one at home too.

  It does not have a pot warmer and that is what attracted us but the coffee brewed is not hot.   Each cup has to be reheated in a micowave.   Filling with water is not easy.   It is obvious, the designer never made a pot of coffee but the unit looks good though.   Very disappointed in the new Krups.

The manufacturer calls the metal, milled steel," which seems like a polished stainless steel to me.  Water is heated and starts being pumped to the grinds nearly instantly when you turn this unit on.  It's not unusual for a 10 cup coffeemaker to take twice as long to brew, so this shorter brewing cycle cuts energy consumption in half.   You can even shut it off before the 8 minute auto-off cycle.  Then, there is no need to power a hot plate to keep the coffee hot, the coffee keeps hot in the carafe. The coffee brewed by this unit is great, smooth and not bitter.

Using good beans to start with, and a good grind, I get quite a tasty cup from the machine providing I follow a couple precautions.     The main issue I have with it is that I ca not make a satisfactory strength at maximum brew capacity.   I can fit roughly 6 Tbs into the filter basket without an overflow issue.   If I try more than that, I end up with coffee grounds in the carafe and a poor cup.   My solution is to not make full batches, but rather limit myself to 6 cups of coffee instead of the advertised 10.

The very first pot of coffee leaked all over the countertop as did most subsequent pots.   Not to worry, however, as the pot does not even brew now.   The display window shows an Err2 message preventing the pot from starting.   Some in the household think that is the best thing the coffee maker has done since taking it out of the box.   This pot is going back to the store today.   I really expected so much more from KitchenAid, why do they jeopardize their brand by producing such an inferior product.

Once we received it unpacked it, followed the directions, it was making coffee for us instantaneously.  The only downfall I could think of is it needs enough counter-space.  We have ours caddy-cornered and it fits nicely right under the cabinet, but needs to stick out a little to pour the water in.  So if you are tight on counter-space, I would not recommend it.      We are very pleased with our purchase and seeming it is a recent purchase I am guessing it will outlive our past coffee makers.  I'll have to get back with you all in a few years on this one.

Since 2 hours is the max, when I get coffee, I turn it off and then immediately back on.  That allows for an extension of time to keep that coffee hot and flavorful.     I like the additional filtration that is inside the water well, which is a charcoal filter.  Finding a new one is a real problem.  However, I have found them on the internet.     It also has the optional feature of the gold filter.

The frothier works real well also and heat the milk up relatively fast.  And I love the adjustable coffee dispenser, It raises and lower to adjust to your cup size.   It is very easy to cleans a matter of fact is self cleans the coffee dispenser after each use.  It also shuts itself off automatically after 3 hrs.  if you leave it on.  I know it's a lot of money but I do think it will pay for itself in the long run.

  When you use less finely ground coffee, the brew is weak even with the Strong setting selected.   Either way, the internal water output bends the filter in half and the grounds spill out.   If you use paper filters alone, they are often bent by the internal water output as it moves into place when you close the top. SLOW SLOW SLOW.   It takes entirely too long to brew coffee - approximately 5-7 minutes for 8 cups on strong setting.   The normal setting is faster (2-3 minutes for 8 cups), but the coffee looks and tastes like dirty water.

It's light, tough, and cleans up beautifully -- no wiping or rinsing is necessary.  But it makes such good coffee that I started using it at home and soon retired both my drip coffee maker and my stovetop espresso maker.  I've had to leave two behind and buy new ones because people (including my mom) became enamored of mine and would not let me leave with it.  I bring it on road trips so as to avoid the torture of hotel and gas station coffee.  If they provide hot water for tea, the Aeropress is good to go.

I use filtered water already, so the filtration system was not a draw for me.   It has some descaling notification feature; but I ca not comment on how useful it is as I have not used it.   It seems to make a good cup of coffee as one would expect.   The dripless carafe is not dripless.   The worst feature is the water level indicator.   It is  a tiny tube that is hard to read even when you bend down to get a bird's eye view.

My first disappointment came after filling the removable water reservoir.  This takes a moment, during which the valve at the bottom makes just enough contact to spill water all over your countertop.      My next step was to add coffee grounds to the filter basket.  This could be especially hazardous if you set the appliance to brew while unattended.  You will absolutely be able to pour coffee, but only a portion of it will make it into the cup.  The spout on the carafe is not correctly engineered, leading to coffee pouring down the side of the carafe.

Why did I buy an espresso maker.  My apartment kitchen is so tiny that I do not have the counter space for a traditional coffee maker.  For my taste, I dilute the coffee more than recommended, and it makes a couple of cups of sweet, strong coffee- just enough for one person.  I like that the coffee is boiling hot when it's done, as many drip machines make lukewarm coffee at best.

This eliminates the need to buy anything else but the coffee.  With my previous drip maker, I always ran out of filters at the worst possible time.     Coffee quality is good, comparable to any other drip coffee maker I've experienced.  There's enough room in the filter to hold grinds sufficient to make very strong coffee for me.     It's worth noting that a "4-cup" coffee maker means the little carafe will fill 4 dainty little coffee cups of about 5 oz each.  "Two mug" would be a more realistic serving size based upon the way most people today drink coffee.

- The area below the express maker is too high for an express cup and too low for a standard express pot.   Still have not found something that fits properly.  - The steaming element is very short and it is impossible to remove your espresso without hitting this very hot element. - The espresso is never very hot. This is not my first machine and I'm disappointed.

Trust me I looked at all of them and this is the best 4 cup coffee maker out there.   It takes up very little space, and is easy to clean.  It brews excellent coffee and pretty quickly too.  I use it everyday and it is very durable.   I would definitely buy it again.

For the genre, it's a good looking and working unit, but does take a little getting used to.  The tabs on the water reservoir work well once you get the hang of them.  Likewise, you have to be sure to close the coffee basket all the way (you'll feel it click) and push the carafe all the way into the machine.  If you do not, it will overflow and make a mess.  (Yes, I learned this the hard way. ) The coffee is plenty hot enough for me and the carafe does a good job of keeping it warm for hours.

This coffee maker has a good design, but the materials seem rather cheap (to go along with the price).  It had a very strong plastic smell when I first opened it.  I ran many cups of hot water through it, then let it sit for several months and the smell seemed to go away.  It has not worked since.

I like this coffeemaker particularly because you start with unground coffee beans, and the 454 grinds them at the time you make the pot.     The grinder is the unique Capresso true grinder, rather than a blender-type high-speed chopping blade.  This results in a much more consistent grind and does not overheat the coffee as blade-type grinders do, retaining more flavor.     It also comes with a gold-plated metal cone filter that I do not use.  I've never liked metal coffee filters, as they clog up with use, and need to be cleaned after each pot.  Instead, I prefer to use a throwaway paper filter (Melitta size 4), which simplifies and shortens the process considerably.

It comes with three grounds holders, 1-cup, 2-cup, and one for the PODS.  As most of the Espresso makers on the market, you ca not use a standard size cup to collect your java, they're way too tall.  The mechanism is simple and you manually control the amount of water dispensed.      Coffee Section: As eluded to by a previous reviewer, the production of coffee is really s-l-o-w.  The design allows you to grab a cup while its still brewing.  In the case of this carafe I ca not seen to be able to pour anything out of it without the liquid pouring all over the place.

The coffee is ready in under five minutes.  The water is easy to pour in at the back.  The filter part of the machine swings out and is easy to fill with coffee grinds.  The mesh filter has a handle on the top, so it is easy to pull out and clean.

It was $25 for a remanufactured model, and looked pretty cool, but I did not *need* it just then, so it sat in the box in storage for a few months.  Then my older HomeCafe gave up the ghost, so this critter came out of storage.     Unlike other pod brewers I've used, the KP1010 uses two side-by-side pod holders with separate spouts coming out into the cup.  You can choose to make one or two cups, each 6. 0 ounces, or one or two "specialty" cups for the larger latte/vanilla/cappucino pods that are increasingly hard to find.  (There is no two-pod holder, and the specialty holder is probably too big for the two-cup pods like the newer cappucino ones.

This is a wonderful coffee maker.  The 580 makes a terrific tasting cup of hot coffee.  Features like an in line filter, and gold tone filter(two filters) makes this coffee maker a class act. The easy to use auto settings were easy to figure out.

The 10 cup capacity seemed quite a bit smaller than our 14 cup Cuisinart, but the 14 cup always seemed a bit large.  But here are the real issues that are making me look for a replacement for this less than 6-month old machine.  After the tenth or fifteenth time, cleaning this mess up starts to feel like an exercise in masochism. The carafe: for some odd design quirk, it seems almost impossible to pour liquid from this carafe without getting a dribble outside the pouring lip.  You dribble pouring cold water in the reservoir, and you dribble pouring hot coffee in a cup.

I am quite surprised by all of the negative reviews about this coffee maker.   I've had mine for 4 1/2 years now and have had no problems with overflows, clogged filters, shattered glass, or lukewarm coffee.   The cap on the carafe is open when brewing (that's how the coffee gets in there) and remains open while sitting under the brewer.  If you leave it there you'll likely have lukewarm coffee within 30 minutes.   So please remove it if you want hot coffee hours after it's initial brewing.

On work days, we use the more efficient cone-filter coffee pot that has the coffee ready when we get up.  Although the cone-filter coffee is quite good, at its best it does not equal the vacuum coffee.     The Bodum coffee maker has serious design flaws that require careful attention to avoid accidents.  Perhaps the greatest danger results from the handle, which is a somewhat flexible plastic that grips the narrow neck of the lower bowl.

It brews great tasting hot coffee, much better than my previous Black and Decker.  The coffee maker's black color and stainless steel styling looks great and the unit is easy to clean and easy to operate.  The water reservoir lid, filter holder, and carafe lid easily detach and can be placed in the dishwasher or dried by hand.  The instructions recommend that the carafe be hand-washed only.

I recently went through 4 different coffee makers trying to get a good cup of coffee.   None of the coffee makers were unknowns, and they all had excellent reviews.   This makes the best pot of coffee I have had in some time.   It is my belief that most coffee machines that are listed has having 'smooth coffee' generally mean bland coffee.   Coffee is supposed to be robust and flavorful and have plenty of aroma.   What it is not supposed to be is bitter.

, plenty for even smaller three lattes at once) but runs a bit low on steam for large jobs.   It is an inexpensive unit and has its quirks as a result.   All in all considering the price this thing is excellent.   Throw the plastic tamper away and get (or make from 1 1/2 pvc pipe cap) a proper 58 mm tamper.

It does not include damage to the product resulting from accident, misuse, or repairs by unauthorized personnel.  Black & Decker has a toll- free Consumer Assistance number for questions regarding warranty or service.  However, the feature that sold us on the  Black & Decker VersaBrew Plus  model was the 2-hour automatic shut-off button.  I also like the Sneak-A-Cup interrupt feature when I'm in a hurry or just need a quick caffeine fix.  The programmable feature is easy to use and another of the features that solidified our decision to purchase this model.  The only drawbacks I have found so far are the fact that this model is not easy to clean.

When it brews correctly, I do not believe you could find a better cup of coffee.  But, so many times we find ourselves mopping up a leaky mess because it does not drain correctly into the carafe.  We've tried different courseness of grinds, but ca not determine that that's the problem.  It brews quickly and IF it drains properly into the carafe, everything's great.  The carafe maintains the coffee temperature for a decent amount of time & pours easily.  But if half of what you've brewed winds up on the counter, the end does not justify the means.

   (There is no warming tray with the stainless carafe.  This has been a great disappointment to both of us.   We have gotten by with it but in all honesty if I ca not have a Bunn I will most likely return to my beloved Proctor Silex.   (The coffee tasted just as good as in the Zijirushi and for less the price. )All in all, it's an okay coffee maker.   Nothing great, nothing horrible.

While brewing, the water reaches temperatures of over 200° F.  Once the process is finished the carafe keeps the coffee at a constant temperature of 180° F up to 6 hours.  This makes your afternoon cup just as satisfying as your first cup of the day.        Another unique feature is the gold-mesh cone shaped filter (#4); I simply rinse it with soap and water after each use.        Because of the insulated thermal carafe, do not place it in the dishwasher.  The carafe lid is specially designed to ensure optimal flavor retention.

I like the look of it, it kinda has a retro vintage kitchen look to it.    It's easy to program and easy to use.   I have long loved my KitchenAid appliances and this one is no different.   It is high quality and should provide years of worry free ownership.  The unit measures 14 by 14 by 8-1/2 inches and carries a one-year hassle-free replacement warranty.  It also come in white & black.
